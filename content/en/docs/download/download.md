> Instructions:
> 
> - It is recommended to use the latest version of the HugeGraph software package. Please select Java11 for the runtime environment.
> - To verify downloads, use the corresponding hash (SHA512), signature, and [Project Signature Verification KEYS](https://downloads.apache.org/hugegraph/KEYS).
> - Instructions for checking hash (SHA512) and signatures are on the [Validate Release](/docs/contribution-guidelines/validate-release) page, and you can also refer to [ASF official instructions](https://www.apache.org/dyn/closer.cgi#verify).
> - Note: The version numbers of all components of HugeGraph have been kept consistent, and the version numbers of Maven repositories such as `client/loader/hubble/common` are the same. You can refer to these for dependency references [maven example](https://github.com/apache/hugegraph-toolchain#maven-dependencies).
> - Compatibility note: after HugeGraph graduated in January 2026, download paths moved from `/incubator/hugegraph` to `/hugegraph`. Historical release file names may still include `-incubating-`.
> - To build from source, refer to [build from source](/docs/quickstart/hugegraph/hugegraph-server).
