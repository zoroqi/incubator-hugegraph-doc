# Community roster data

`roster.json` is the checked-in, visitor-facing snapshot of current Apache
HugeGraph PMC members and Committers. It is generated from the three ASF public
sources recorded in the file:

```bash
python3 scripts/community_roster.py refresh
python3 scripts/community_roster.py validate --warn-after-days 90
```

`refresh` is a maintainer-run operation. It finishes all source, role, mapping,
and avatar checks before atomically replacing the last-good roster. It never
pushes or opens a pull request.

`github-map.json` is deliberately maintained by human review. A mapping must
record both the exact GitHub login and the account's numeric GitHub user ID.
Do not derive mappings from a person's name, email address, employer, or commit
history. Leave an ASF ID unmapped until a maintainer has confirmed the account.

Mapped avatars are downloaded during refresh, converted with `cwebp` when
needed, stripped of metadata, checked as 128 by 128 WebP, and stored under a
SHA-256 content-addressed filename. Unmapped members render initials as static
cards without requiring JavaScript.

The fixed `validate` command is fully offline and checks checked-in data,
identity rules, and local avatar files. Render the site separately, then opt in
to artifact checks:

```bash
hugo --destination /safe/prebuilt/site
python3 scripts/community_roster.py validate \
  --warn-after-days 90 \
  --artifact /safe/prebuilt/site
```

The artifact option never invokes Hugo or downloads modules itself.

Once the verified assets and roster are published, removal of an unreferenced
old avatar is best effort. A cleanup failure emits an Actions warning but does
not invalidate or roll back the complete new bundle.
